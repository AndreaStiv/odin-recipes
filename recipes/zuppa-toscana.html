<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zuppa toscana is a broad based term, literally meaning
 "Tuscan soup" but in Italy it is called "Minestra di Pane" meaning "Bread Soup".
  Classic zuppa toscana normally is a soup made from kale, zucchini, cannellini beans,
   potatoes, celery, carrots, onion, tomato pulp, extra virgin olive oil, salt, 
   powdered chili, toasted Tuscan bread, and rigatino (an Italian bacon)</p>
   <p>The onion, carrots and celery are diced and tossed in hot oil and salt.
     The other vegetables are then added with the chili and cooked
      for about 15 minutes. Water is added and the mixture is simmered for around
       30 minutes. The soup is served on toasted Tuscan bread, with just a tiny splash
        of extra virgin olive oil.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch piece</li>
            <li>1 large onion, dice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
            <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven 
                over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink,
                 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp,
                 about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings
                  with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions 
                  and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent,
                   about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and
                 onion mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes,
                  and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 
                  medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; 
                  heat through. Mix the spinach into the soup just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
